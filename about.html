            <h2>JOKER STEALS BATMAN’S THUNDER</h2>
            <h3>Batman Vol. 1</h3>
            <p>Much like Moriarty in the original Sherlock Holmes stories, the Joker decides to hire himself out to
                criminals in this early tale, providing them with schemes, resources, and escape plans. Knowing the
                value of
                strong branding, the Clown Prince of Crime equips himself as an Anti-Batman, with a Jokermobile and
                Jokergyro (as in the flying machine, not the sandwich). To summon his help, criminals are given personal
                Joker signals, because there’s nothing that better ensures a discreet getaway from the authorities than
                projecting the image of an evil clown face in the sky that leads to your location.</p>
            <p>This story involves memorable scenes such as the Joker somehow causing the Batplane to slow down by
                attaching
                parachutes to its wings, and the Dark Knight escaping a death trap with nothing but a piece of wood and
                string. Although there is a later classic story where the Joker copies Batman’s utility belt, this story
                gets points for coming out first, having the villain copy more than one bat-item, and in general is
                definitely wackier.

            <h2>GAMBLE WITH DOOM </h2>
            <h3>Batman Vol. 1</h3>
            <p>After a successful night at an underground casino, the Joker decides he likes gambling so much that he’s
                going to use it as his next death-trap theme. Luring the Dynamic Duo into a specially made casino, he
                challenges Batman to win three games, each one involving the Boy Wonder as a game piece. Robin is the
                ball in an electrified pinball machine, then tied to a post on a playing board where giant dice may
                crush him, and is finally trapped in a gas chamber where he will only be freed if his mentor picks the
                right card (just how much trauma can one kid take in one night?). Despite this rather disturbing
                scenario, Batman’s major complaint is, “But I told you, I hate all gambling!”</p>
            <p>This story is also a great example of how much Golden Age comics loved oversized props and death traps
                that even James Bond would consider a bit much.</p>

            <h2>JOKER’S CRIME COSTUMES</h2>
            <h3>Batman Vol. 1</h3>
            <p>This one is another story where the Joker’s inspiration is his hated enemy. After visiting an exhibit of
                specialized costumes that Batman wore on particular missions, the Joker decides that crime is better
                with cosplay. Like a good literature nerd, he commits crimes as Shakespeare’s Falstaff, Dickins’ Mr.
                Pickwick, and Twain’s Connecticut Yankee, before resorting to nursery rhyme figures like Simple Simon
                and King Cole.</p>
            <p>Batman and Robin are able to turn the tables at last by setting a trap. The two dress up as Santa and
                Little Jack Horner, laugh as they pelt the Joker with plums, and trap him in a giant pie. Why has this
                never been adapted for a live-action film? Pie trap! Genius!</p>
